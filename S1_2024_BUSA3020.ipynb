    "The primary goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the prices of listed cars based on certain vehicle features, such as year, horsepower, fuel economy, and power etc. The information collected from this analysis will inform stakeholders of the impact of specific features on car price value. Consumers can leverage the findings to make a more informed decision when buying or selling a vehicle. Car dealerships and online marketplaces can optimise  their pricing strategies based on features that have the most impact on car value. Additionally, insurance companies can utilise this data to determine insurance premiums based on car value.\n",

    "The evaluation criteria for assessing the performance of the forecast model will be measured on the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). This error metric will indicate the regression modelâ€™s performance by comparing the average percentage difference between the predicted and actual prices. For selecting a suitable model, the MAPE results of different forecast models will be contrasted, and the model with the lowest MAPE score will be utilised for the car value analysis. Although MAPE is a widely utilised metric for forecast evaluation, it is sensitive to outliers which may skew the forecasting evaluation accuracy. Therefore, to ensure the reliability and integrity of the results, this limitation will be carefully considered in the analysis. "
