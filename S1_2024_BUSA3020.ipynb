    "The primary goal of this exploratory data analysis is to develop predictive models to accurately estimate car prices based on various features, such as year, horsepower, fuel economy, and power. To prepare the data for predictive modelling, common analytical techniques will be employed to correctly prepare the data, like handling missing values, and feature engineering. This model aims to identify which attributes have the most significant impact on car value to provide useful insights to stakeholders for more informed decision-making. Consumers can leverage the findings to make a more informed decision when buying or selling a vehicle. Car dealerships and online marketplaces can optimise their pricing strategies based on features that have the most impact on car value. Additionally, insurance companies can utilise this data to determine insurance premiums based on the results collected from predictive analysis.\n",

    "- $n$ is the number of observations,\n",
    "- $A_i$ is the actual value\n",
    "- $F_i$ is the forecasted value\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAPE metric is used to measure the accuracy of forecast models, and expresses the difference between the forecasted and actual values as a percentage. For optimal model selection, the model with the lowest MAPE is typically considered the most suitable for the dataset. \n",
    "However, it is also crucial to ensure that the model is not overfitted. Overfitted models can achieve a lower MAPE score by being overly tailored to the training data, but perform poorly on unseen data. Since MAPE is expressed as a percent, it is easily understood by non-technical stakeholders. \n"

    "These statistics on price distribution reflect market trends, product demand, and availibilities of certain vehicles. The average price of listed cars is approximately `$28851` which gives insight into typical range of car prices, so more regular priced vehicles are being advertised due to the higher availability of lower end cars. The 75th percentile is `$36992` which indicates that 75% of listed cars falls below this value, so typically regular priced cars are being listed over higher end; however, the presence of higher outliers reveals that there still are some high-end luxury cars being listed too.
